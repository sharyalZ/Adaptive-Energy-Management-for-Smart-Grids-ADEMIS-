The lower bound of the optimization problem under study can be found using duality concept. The primal and dual using Lagrangian for standard SOCP formulation can be defined as:\\ \\
\textbf{Primal (P):}

\[
  min \hspace{0.1cm}f^Tx
\]

\[
  subject \hspace{0.1cm}to: \lVert Ax+b \rVert \leq c^Tx+d
\]
\textbf{Dual Function:}

\[
 L(x, \lambda, \mu) = f^Tx+\sum_i \lambda_i^T(A_ix+b_i)-\mu_i(c_i^T+d_i)
\]

\[
  \mathcal{L}(\lambda, \mu) = min_x \hspace{0.1cm} f^Tx+\sum_i \lambda_i^T(A_ix+b_i)-\mu_i(c_i^T+d_i)
\]
\textbf{Dual (D):}


\[
  max_{\lambda,\mu} \hspace{0.1cm} \sum_i b_i^T\lambda_i - d_i\mu_i
\]

\[
  subject \hspace{0.1cm}to: l+\sum_iA^T_i\lambda_i - c_i\mu_i = 0
\]

\[
  \left \|  \lambda_i  \right \| \leq \mu_i 
\]

Dual and primal are related as: $D \leq P$. If $D=P$, then strong duality holds and the optimal solution for dual is also an optimal solution for the primal. If the problem is convex then Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions are necessary as well as sufficient to find the optimal solution for dual and primal. KKT conditions for standard SOCP is listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stationary: $\nabla L(x,\lambda, \mu) = 0$
    \item Primal Feasibility: $\lVert Ax+b \rVert \leq c^Tx+d$
    \item Dual Feasibility: $\left \|  \lambda_i  \right \| \leq \mu_i$ 
    \item Complementary Slackness: $\lambda_i^T(A_ix+b_i)-\mu_i(c_i^T+d_i)=0$
\end{itemize}

Applying the stationary condition would result in a system of equation for the problem. These system of equations can be solved using the solution information obtained from the slackness and solution for dual and primal problems are found. As it can be seen that this process can become tedious when performed with hand, that's why commercially available solvers such as Gurobi would be used to directly input SOCP formulation and find optimal solution for it.
