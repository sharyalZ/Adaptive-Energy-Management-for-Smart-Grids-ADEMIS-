\textcolor{blue}{The relaxation of some constraints (i.e. no longer considering them) in the original problem may be used in order to determine a lower bound. Relaxing the network constraints (power flow, etc.) can lead to such a lower bound. These specific constraints may indeed represent an important source of computing time. Relaxing these may therefore lead to a lower bound accessible with a limited computing time.}
