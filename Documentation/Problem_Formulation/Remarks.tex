\section{Remarks}

Aspects to consider in the next versions of the problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Three-phase, unbalanced power flow (necessitate to include voltage unbalance constraints too)}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Pseudo-stochastic and stochastic approaches}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Asynchronism}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{Failures (e.g. one or more agent not responding or with a significant delay, etc.)}
    \item ...
\end{itemize}
