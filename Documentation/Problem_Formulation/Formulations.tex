\section{Formulation:}

 A step-wise procedure to formulate the problem under study for optimization is presented here. First a quadratic constrained programming(QCP) problem is formulated; which is also non-convex. Two simplifying strategies are explored i.e. linearization of the problem and constrained relaxations. For linearization, linearized power flow and decoupled power flow approaches are listed. For relaxation, first the problem is converted to a semi-definite problem and finally to a second-order cone problem, which can be solved using commercial solvers.

 \subsection{Lower Bound:}
 
 \textcolor{blue}{Several approaches can be used to determine a lower bound: using the dual of the problem and/or relaxing some constraints in the original problem.}
